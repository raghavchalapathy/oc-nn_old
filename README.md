Models for one class neural networks
The repository consists of code for models for experiments in [Anomaly Detection using One-Class Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06360).
The steps to reproduce the experiments are :
1) git clone https://github.com/raghavchalapathy/oc-nn.git
2) cd oc-nn
3) Download the data and required models folder from this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bsW48TGwFwAnRhBtY7Uncq7sKsdMvqIv) and place inside the directory oc-nn
4) Download the folders : lstm_autoencoders, trained_models which consists of pre-trained models and place it inside path 
   oc-nn/models folder
5) Kindly make sure the paths are local to your running environments and 
6) Execute the experiments present in the kdd_2018_conference_experiments.ipynb notebook
